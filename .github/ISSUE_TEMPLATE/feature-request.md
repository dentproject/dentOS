**Overview**
Describe the feature and what it should do. This should be at least one sentence and may be several. Preferably, this is not a bullet point list but rather a verbose description of the thing.

**Use Case**
Succinctly describe how the feature will be used. Providing a sense of scale (instances of this feature) and performance requirements would be helpful. One or two sentences should be adequate.

**Operation**
- List how the feature works. Include details such as what packages are required, packet types are manipulated, etc. if such details are known.
- Describe how the user interacts with the feature and if userspace tool development seems necessary.
- Optionally, provide some high level insight on how the feature may be implemented

**Testing**
Optionally, explain how this feature could be tested, what a preferred test method may be or who will write the test case.

**Sponsoring organization**
Provide the name of the organization(s) that will be developing the feature or a portion of it.
